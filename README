Data-ChipsChallenge version 0.01
================================

This module provides an interface for reading and writing to Chip's Challenge
data files ("CHIPS.DAT") that is shipped with Best of Windows Entertainment
Pack's Chip's Challenge.

Chip's Challenge is a 2D tilebased maze game. The goal of each level is usually
to collect a certain number of computer chips, so that a chip socket can be
opened and the player can get to the exit and proceed to the next level.

This module is able to read and manipulate the data file that contains all
these levels. For some examples, see those in the "eg" folder shipped with
this module.

Documentation on the CHIPS.DAT file format can be found at this location:
http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/ccfile.html

This module only provides the mechanism for which you can read and manipulate
a CHIPS.DAT game file. However, it cannot include a copy of the official
CHIPS.DAT, as that file is copyrighted by its creators. If you have an original
copy of the Chip's Challenge game from the BOWEP collection, you can use its
CHIPS.DAT with this module.

If you don't have a copy of the game (and I imagine you don't, since the game
was only well-known in the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 era), you can always,
um, search Google for it. But I didn't say that.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

If you don't have these modules, immediately alert your local sysadmin about how
your Perl installation is unstable and logically shouldn't even be able to
exist right now.
